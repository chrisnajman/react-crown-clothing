E-commerce site built with Create React App following Udemy Course: [Complete React Developer in 2019](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery)
## Lesson 1
- Install node-sass
- Create and build out homepage.component.jsx
- Create and build out homepage.styles.scss
- Link SCSS to component
  
  ### Notes
  - Think I might prefer CSS Modules but I'll go along with SCSS for this course.
  - Might prefer different convention for file naming but again I'll go with the course conventions.
